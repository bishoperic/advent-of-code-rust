# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code, written in Rust. I'm a little late to the party with this, and I haven't yet gotten through all of puzzles, but want to try and finish it eventually. This was my first time using Rust, so it's bound to be far from great code, but it was a good way to get my feet wet actually programming something with it.
